Rolling a d20 with only one d6 die

Doing some mental gymnastics, I was thinking about emulating regular D&D dice with only d6s.  
But then I thought, 'People have alredy asked this online...  Yep.  But I think I done did find a new method of rolling a D20 with ONLY ONE d6.
I made up a 3X5 index card and worked it out.  And it works.

## The idea
reading through the ways people posted online on how to emulate dice with other dice I read one little snippet.  'Which side of the dice faces true north'.  
Only one person that I know of thought of this.  

# Use the top of the die (like normal) and use the side of the die that is facing you.

While not oritional (someone HAS to have thought about this before), I have not found a person that has thought of this.  There are:
* 6 possible outcomes for the top (normal)
* 4 possible outcomes for the side facing you
* a D24 on a regular d6 die.

So here is what I came up with:

Or to make a 1-6 table:
|  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 |   | X | X | X | X |   |
| 2 | X |   | X | X |   | X |
| 3 | X | X |   |   | X | X |
| 4 | X | X |   |   | X | X |
| 5 | X |   | X | X |   | X |
| 6 |   | X | X | X | X |   |
